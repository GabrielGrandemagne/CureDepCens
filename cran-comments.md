## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted the DESCRIPTION title to title case.

* Also changed the github repository from private to public.

* Modified function names.

* There is a NOTE when testing for Windows Server:

* checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
  'lastMiKTeXException'
I cant find this file/directory anywhere in the package repository, also there are no notes or errors in the win-builder.
